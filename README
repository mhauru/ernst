Ernst is a simple 2D spin lattice model simulator, written in Haskell by Markus Hauru (markus.hauru@gmail.com).

Use cabal-install to build the package with the necessary dependencies and the makefile for quick local builds e.g. for development work.
Note that cabal install should install the required dependecies from hackage, but you may still need to install GTK2 and libglade2 as
the Haskell libraries do not work with newer versions of GTK and Glade.

Note also that ernst must always be compiled with the -threaded flag! The makefile and cabal take care of this.

Using the program itself is quite self-explanatory.  It uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for updating the lattice and aims to be easy
to modify for various kinds of couplings in spin lattice models, other than nearest-neighbour, external field and diagonal.
Hopefully in the future ernst will support richer degrees of freedom than simple booleans (Potts, Heisenberg, etc.).
