Ernst is a simple 2D spin lattice model simulator, written in Haskell
by Markus Hauru (markus.hauru@gmail.com).

Use cabal-install to build the package with the necessary dependencies
and the makefile for quick local builds e.g. for development work.

Note that ernst must always be compiled with the -threaded flag!

Using the program itself is quite self-explanatory.
It uses Metropolis-Hastings for updating the lattice and aims to be easy
to modify for various kinds of couplings in spin lattice models, other
than nearest-neighbour, external field and diagonal.
Hopefully in the future ernst will support richer degrees of freedom
than simple booleans (Potts, Heisenberg, etc.).
